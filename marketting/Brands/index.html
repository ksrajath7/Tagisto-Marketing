            <h2>WHY TAGISTO FOR BRANDS</h2>
                <p>BRANDS /STORES PAGE (Page 3 )The  most  impactful  digital  marketing  platform  
                    ensuring  quantifiable  brand loyalty and sale We help you to add a personal touch 
                    to product presentation content, styling your products through our TAGSTA community 
                    and also gain access to resourceful and meaningful data to help your growth hacking strategies.  
                     WHY TAGISTO FOR BRANDS  Conventional  approaches  to  marketing  offline/online  are  partially 
                      effective  and almost impossible to quantify. After the advent of social media, online sales
                       around the  globe  have  increased  considerably;  the  trend  now  has  funnelled  towards
                        purchases induced by social media influencers and content creators. A presence on TAGISTO 
                         most  certainly  enhances  brand  visibility  and  quantifies  responses  from shoppers
                          through inbuilt features – real-time analytics and performance indicators. TAGISTO is
                           like a digital shopping mall where brands can open stores and connect to customers, 
                           give live updates on new arrivals, offers etc and also collaborate with content creators 
                           to reach out to more audience and thereby 
                    giving your customers a refreshing and entertaining medium of shopping. </p>

            <h2>UNIVERSAL CHECKOUT</h2>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 40px;">Universal Checkout unique feature to the TAGISTO app is a
                     frictionless shopping experience allowing the shopper to get inspired and purchase 
                     items at any point of time   during   cruising,   ensuing   instant   gratification 
                       and   eventually   growing conversion.  Unlike  other  commercial  platforms,  the
                         consumer  has  the  option  to browse and add products from multiple stores in one 
                         cart and complete the buy at just  one  checkout  point.  The  process  is  hassle-free,  
                         which  means  the  prospective customer  need  just  check  if  the  product  of  his
                           choice  is  available  according  to requirement  (product  colour,  size  etc.)  while
                             window  shopping.  This  reduces  the chances of basket abandonment which comes 
                             about if the consumer has to browse
                     from one site to the next repeating the exercise while making purchases. </p>
